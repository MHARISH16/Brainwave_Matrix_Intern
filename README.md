## Fake News Detection

### Introduction
The spread of fake news is a significant issue in the digital era. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify news articles as real or fake based on their content.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled news articles, with each article classified as either "real" or "fake." The dataset includes:
- **Title**: The headline of the news article.
- **Text**: The main content of the news article.
- **Label**: The target variable where `1` represents fake news and `0` represents real news.

### Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
- **Text Cleaning**: Removal of special characters, stop words, and converting text to lowercase.
- **Tokenization**: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
- **Vectorization**: Converting processed text into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

### Modeling
The following models were tested:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of **X%** (replace with your result) in classifying news articles as fake or real.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- TF-IDF Vectorizer

## Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Introduction
Credit card fraud is a growing concern in the financial industry. This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques, allowing for timely intervention and prevention of financial losses.

### Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of credit card transaction records, with each transaction labeled as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The dataset includes:
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Amount**: The transaction amount.
- **Date and Time**: When the transaction occurred.
- **Label**: The target variable where `1` represents fraud and `0` represents a legitimate transaction.

### Modeling
Various machine learning models were used, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **Y%** (replace with your result) in identifying fraudulent transactions.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest (Choose the model you used)

## Conclusion
These projects showcase the application of machine learning techniques to tackle real-world problems, including fake news detection and credit card fraud detection. Both models can be further refined and improved with additional data and advanced algorithms.
